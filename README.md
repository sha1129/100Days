# 100Days

I am challenging myself to learn something continuously for 100 days. Each day there will be commit that will show my progress. At the end, weather I learn something or not making a habit is important. 

### I failed but I learned some skills and gained some habits 

Also learned that I should have better descriptions for my commits
